Date of birth validator made with react-hook-form. If the user date of birth input indicates an age less than 18 years old, the validator would reset the date of birth as of today minus 18 years. User gets notified, that the age should be at least 18 years and the the date of birth has been reset. 

Try it out by choosing any birth year different from the current year - 18. Choose birth month different from the current one. Then set birth year again to the maximum possible. The date will reset. You'll see the warning. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
